      icon: "img/movement_move.png"
      description: |
        A simple move action. Players can move equal yards to their MOV stat.
      cost: 1 move action

    "Sprint":
      icon: "img/movement_sprint.png"
      description: |
        Travel up to 5x further than a regular move action in a single turn. Any combat actions made
        this round either before or following the Sprint must incur a penalty die. If you have a MOV
        of 8 or more, opponents using firearms against you while sprinting will incur +1 penalty die
        against you.
      cost: "1 move action, +1 penalty die"
      gain: "5x movement distance; opponent penalty +1 if using firearms (MOV 8+ only)"

    "Take Cover":
      icon: "img/movement_take_cover.png"
      description: |
        Position self behind cover, either full or partial. If under partial cover, all ranged firearm
        attacks made against you will receive a penalty die. In full cover, ranged attacks will be
        unable to hit; however you will automatically enter partial cover or become exposed if you move
        (for example, leaning out of cover to take a shot).
      cost: 1 move action
      gain: "+1 penalty die on opponent's attack // firearms immunity (when fully covered)"

    "Perform Action":
      icon: "img/movement_perform_action.png"
      description: |
        Using your combat action, perform any non-combat action (e.g. apply first aid, lockpick a door,
        climb to a vantage point). Depending on the action you wish to take, the keeper may ask you to
        roll a specific skill.
      cost: 1 combat action

    "Assist Action":
      icon: "img/movement_assist_action.png"
      description: |
        Offer another player help during your turn this round so they can perform an action (e.g.
        handing medical equipment during first aid, distracting enemies, giving a lift during a climb).
        Grants the assisted player an additional bonus die for their roll.
      cost: 1 combat action
      gain: "+1 bonus die for assisted player"

    "Hold Action":
      icon: "img/movement_hold_action.png"
      description: |
        Spend both your movement and combat action holding your turn â€” effectively not acting this
        round. Depending on how you describe holding your action, you may be granted a bonus die for
        your next turn (e.g. holding to anticipate an attack may grant a bonus to dodge or fight back).
        The GM may require additional skill rolls if the reasoning for holding your action warrants it.
      cost: 1 turn
      gain: "+1 bonus die next turn (if GM agrees upon player's reasoning)"

    "Flee":
      icon: "img/movement_flee.png"
      description: |
        Spend both your movement and combat action disengaging and fleeing the combat area. It takes
        one full round to successfully flee; even after announcing intent, enemies may still attempt
        to attack or stop you until your next turn. If you successfully flee a scene, a chase sequence
        may follow.
      cost: 1 turn
