"Evasion":
  actions:
    "Dodge Melee":
      icon: "img/evasive_dodge_melee.png"
      skill: "Dodge"
      description: |
        MELEE ATTACKS ONLY. Dodge an attacker's melee attack or combat maneuver using an opposed 
        dodge skill check. A defender's dodge check is an opposed skill roll to the attacker's fighting 
        skill check, so it may still be possible to fail a successful dodge if the attacker rolls a higher 
        success. In the case of a skill check draw, the success goes to the defender. If both fail their 
        skill checks, no damage is inflicted.
      cost: 1 evasive action

    "Fight Back":
      icon: "img/evasive_fight_back.png"
      skill: "Fighting (Brawl // Weapon)"
      description: |
        MELEE ATTACKS ONLY. Fight back an attacker's melee attack or combat maneuver using an opposed 
        Fighting skill check. A defender's fighting check is an opposed skill roll to the attacker's fighting 
        skill check, so it may still be possible to fail a successful fight back if the attacker rolls a 
        higher success. In the case of a skill check draw, the success goes to your attacker. If both fail 
        their skill checks, you're both at an impasse. Critical/impaling strikes do not occur on extreme 
        successes during a fight back.
      cost: 1 evasive action

    "Dive for Cover":
      icon: "img/evasive_dive_for_cover.png"
      skill: "Dodge"
      description: |
        FIREARM ATTACKS ONLY. If you are aware they are about to be shot at, you may state before the 
        attacker rolls their firearms check that you wish to dive for cover. Make a Dodge check; if 
        successful, your attacker receives a penalty die during their attack. You may dive in any direction 
        up to 1/5th of your DEX in feet. Diving for cover causes you to automatically lose your next combat 
        round.
      cost: "1 evasive action, next combat round"
      gain: "Attacker receives +1 penalty die"
