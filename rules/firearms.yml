        FIREARMS ONLY. When a combat round starts, state you plan to fire as your first action and
        add 50 points to your initiative score (DEX). Your only action this round is to fire your
        weapon; if you move, brawl, take damage or use an evasive action before firing you lose your
        Initiative bonus. You may dodge, counter an attack or take damage as normal once you have
        made your shot. After that round, initiative order returns to normal unless you perform
        another quick fire action in the following round.
      cost: 1 turn
      gain: "+50 Initiative (DEX) for one round"

        to their attack roll. Any shooter within point blank range of an opponent may be targeted
        by melee attacks and could be disarmed, however an opponent will not be able to fight back
        or dodge against firearm attacks.

      description: >
        HANDGUNS OR BURST FIRE WEAPONS ONLY. If your firearm allows multiple shots with a single turn,
        you may fire up to the max number of bullets listed in the firearm's "Attacks" box in a single
        round. Each shot taken during this attack must take a penalty die.

    description: >
      AUTOMATIC WEAPONS ONLY. With an automatic weapon, you can fire up to [X] number of bullets in
      a single volley, with [X] being your weapon skill divided by 10 and rounded down (minimum of
      3 bullets per volley). Upon a successful hit, half of bullets (rounded down) fired in a volley
      hit the target. In an extreme success all bullets hit, plus half rounded down are impaling
      strikes. Successive volleys can be fired in a single turn, however each successive volley
      increases the difficulty of the skill check.
    cost: >
      1 Combat Action for single volley,
      1 Turn for multiple volleys,
      +1 penalty die / difficulty increase for each successive volley in a single turn

        load 2 shells into any weapon that requires manual loading of individual bullets, such as
        revolvers and shotguns. Weapons that use magazine clips take 1 combat action to reload a
        whole clip. It takes two full turns to reload heavy weapon ammunition. You cannot reload
        during the same action as a sprint.
